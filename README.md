# Project Overview and Problem Statement:

The problem at hand pertains to the social cause domain, where many news incidents remain overlooked by traditional media outlets, resulting in a lack of support and assistance for the affected individuals and communities. These unreported incidents create a gap in public awareness about critical events happening at the local level, hindering people's ability to extend help and protect each other effectively. To address this issue, there is a need to establish a platform that empowers individuals to stay informed about their neighborhood's safety and well-being. By fostering a connected and vigilant community, this platform seeks to bridge the gap between unreported incidents and collective support, facilitating immediate assistance and safety measures for individuals and their loved ones. Through the proposed solution, individuals can actively contribute to creating a safer and more supportive environment for everyone in their locality.

# Features

### Responsive Design
Protector's Eye is fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. We have adopted a mobile-first approach to design, ensuring that the application is first optimized for smaller screens and then progressively enhanced for larger screens.

### Fluid Layouts
We use fluid layouts throughout the application, utilizing relative units such as percentages and ems for widths, heights, and paddings. This allows the components to adjust seamlessly to different viewport sizes and aspect ratios.

### Flexbox and Media Queries
To create flexible and adaptive layouts, we rely on CSS Flexbox and media queries. Flexbox enables us to create dynamic arrangements of components, while media queries allow us to apply specific styles based on the screen width.

### Testing on Different Devices
During development, we extensively tested Protector's Eye on various devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktops, to verify its responsiveness and user experience.
